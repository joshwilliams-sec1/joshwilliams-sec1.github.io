## 💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught cybersecurity professional focused on **blue team operations**, **log analysis**, and **threat detection**. I build and publish real-world projects to detect brute-force, PowerShell abuse, and DNS exfiltration using tools like:

- 🛡️ Security Onion
- 🐍 Sigma Rules
- 🔍 Wireshark & Splunk
- 💡 MITRE ATT&CK Framework

> I don't have a degree or certifications — I have real skills, labs, and GitHub receipts.
